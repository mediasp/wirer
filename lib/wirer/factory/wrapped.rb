module Wirer
  # Allows an existing Factory to be wrapped with extra options for a specific context.
  #
  # See Factory#wrapped_with for a convenient way to construct one of these -- although you won't
  # normally need to construct these yourself, rather a Container will wrap factories for you
  # where you add them to the container together with specific options.
  #
  # Allows you to:
  #
  # * Specify additional :features that the wrapped factory provides in this context
  #   (eg to indicate that you provide a specific named version of a more general interface,
  #    a :special_logger rather than just a Logger)
  #
  # * Fix particular initial arguments that get passed to the factory when used in this wrapped context
  #   (eg if you have a factory that takes arguments, but you want to supply those args upfront,
  #    and get a factory that just constructs a particular singleton instance; 'currying')
  #
  # * Add extra requirements to the existing dependencies for this factory. Eg if you have a dependency on
  #   some general interface (eg Logger) and you want to pin it down to a specific named version that you've
  #   made available (like :special_context_logger). Or maybe you want to make an optional dependency into
  #   a non-optional one.
  #
  # * Give a constructor block which allows you customise the way the wrapped factory's new_from_dependencies
  #   method works. It gets passed the wrapped factory, the constructor dependencies and args, and should return
  #   the constructed instance. This is for when specifying :initial_args isn't enough and you need
  #   some custom way of supplying your pre-canned arguments when constructing the thing.
